## Docker Set Up
Make sure you have installed Docker to continue with the instructions in this README

### Docker QuickStart

To start the app:

```
$ docker-compose up --build
```

Next, we'll expose the app over the internet using ngrok. You can install ngrok [here](https://ngrok.com/):

```
ngrok http 8000
```

Navigate to the `Integrations` page in the Berbix console again and add the public URL from ngrok to the `Target URL` field: `http://<####-##-###-#-###>.ngrok.io/hook` 

Now, you should be able to test this webhook from the Integrations page by clicking on `Test`
